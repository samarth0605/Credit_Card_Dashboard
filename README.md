# Credit Card Weekly Dashboard Project

## Project Objective

The primary goal of this project was to develop a comprehensive Power BI dashboard that delivers real-time weekly insights into key performance indicators (KPIs) related to credit card operations. The dashboard enables stakeholders to monitor and analyze trends, performance metrics, and customer behavior to support data-driven decision-making.

## Process Followed

We followed a structured approach, starting from data preparation to visualization:

### 1. Data Preparation & Import (SQL)
- Prepared raw data in CSV format
- Created structured SQL tables
- Imported CSV files into the SQL database for further querying and transformation

### 2. Data Analysis & Visualization (Power BI)
- Connected SQL data to Power BI
- Created interactive dashboards to visualize weekly trends
- Wrote DAX queries for custom metrics and calculated fields
- Generated weekly analytical reports highlighting key revenue and performance trends
